This homework was done with several participants collaborating: Sebastian Bana, Luis Fernando, Sofyia Elyakin, Ben Alpert, Scott Smith, and Jonathan Geis. SB walked us through his script for the first assignment and SE, SS, BA, and JG created their own scripts based on SB's explanations and the resources from class. JG, SE, and BE also collaborated on the thrid assignment during office hours Wednesday evening with help from Dr. Bianco.

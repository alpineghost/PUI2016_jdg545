These assignments were part of several collaborations.
Assignment 1 was done in collaboration with Sebastian Bana, Luis Fernando, Sofiya Elyakin, Scott Smith, and Ben Alpert. Sebastian lead the way and I followed along to understand the different steps.
For assignment 2, we all discussed it together and agreed to the null hypothesis although Scott wanted to test a hypothesis with geo-fencing. Ben Alpert and I worked on the assignment together and relied heavily on the Citibike example notebook that Dr. Bianco shared with the class.
For assignment 3, I had done most of it in class and added the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis. I also had help from Dr. Bianco with the formula since I was incorrectly using the sample standard deviation instead of the population standard deviation.

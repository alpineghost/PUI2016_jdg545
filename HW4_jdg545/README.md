## Assignment 1: Review the Citibike Project of Dam Trang Tran Linh

## Assignment 2: Literature Choices of Statistical Tests
I worked on this assignment with Ben Alpert. I looked at an article that used logistic regression for statistical analysis. The article I read 
is *Acceptance of Home-Based Chlamydia Genital and Anorectal Testing Using Short Message Service (SMS) in Previously Tested Young People and Their Social and Sexual Networks* by Nicole H. T. M. Dukers-Muijrers,  Kevin A. T. M. Theunissen,  Petra T. Wolffs,  Gerjo Kok,  Christian J. P. A. Hoebe and can be found at http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133575

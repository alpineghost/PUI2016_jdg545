# HW 4

## Assignment 1: Review the Citibike Project of Dam Trang Tran Linh

## Assignment 2: Literature Choices of Statistical Tests
I worked on this assignment with Ben Alpert. I looked at an article that used logistic regression for statistical analysis. The article I read is *Acceptance of Home-Based Chlamydia Genital and Anorectal Testing Using Short Message Service (SMS) in Previously Tested Young People and Their Social and Sexual Networks* by Nicole H. T. M. Dukers-Muijrers,  Kevin A. T. M. Theunissen,  Petra T. Wolffs,  Gerjo Kok,  Christian J. P. A. Hoebe and can be found at http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133575. The research paper that Ben chose is *True versus False Parasite Interactions: A Robust Method to Take Risk Factors into Account and Its Application to Feline Viruses* by Eléonore Hellard, Dominique Pontier, Frank Sauvage, Hervé Poulet, David Fouchet, and they used a Chi-Square Analysis. It can be found at http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029618

Chi-Square Analysis |  Number of Viruses/Parasites in Cats | continuous | Different combinations of status (seropositive or seronegative) for the two pathogens | discrete | n/a | n/a | Do pathogen and parasite combinations increase risk (seropositive or seronegative) of virus pairing in domestic cats? | H0: Independent viruses and pathogens are equally or less likely to synergize or double associate and pair in cats possessing multiple parasite and pathogens. | n/a | http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029618 |

## Assignment 3
I collaborated with Sofiya Elyakin and Ben Alpert. Sofiya had worked on it with Sebastian Bana and Marc Toneatto and explained it to us.

## Assignment 4
I collaborated with Sofiya Elyakin and Ben Alpert. We tried different methods to clean up the data and ran the different tests.

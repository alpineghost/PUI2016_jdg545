CLARITY: The plot is very clear to read. There's a descriptive title and clear labels to indicate what the axes represent. The caption and interpretation are very well explained.
To make it a bit clearer, there could be a legend in the plot that explains what the colors represent as well as a scale showing what the size of the dots mean as far as the number of students.

ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?

The plot is beautiful and makes a very interesting use of 3D. It took me a little time to understand what everyhting meant but once I did, I found that all of the information is in the plot in a very elegant way.

HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?
I think that the plot represent the data without deforming it. However, since the plot is in 3D there could be some accuracy lost because of the projection on a 2D screen. It would be interesting to see 3 separate graphs representing the relationshipds between 2 out of the 3 variables to identify the correlation.
